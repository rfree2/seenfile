1              ”O freddled gruntbuggly thy micturations are to me
2             As plured gabbleblochits on a lurgid bee.
3             Groop, I implore thee my foonting turlingdromes.   
4             And hooptiously drangle me with crinkly bindlewurdles,
5             Or I will rend thee in the gobberwarts with my blurlecruncheon, see if I don’t.”
